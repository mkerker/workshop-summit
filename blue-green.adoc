== Doing Advanced Deployments (A/B or Blue Green Deployments)

One of the great parts about having a platform that automates your deployments
is you can now easily do advanced deployments.

Blue/Green deployments and A/B are very similar and very helpful as you roll
out new code. With a blue/green deployment, the production deployments is
called blue. Your new deployment (and code) is called green. While blue is up
and running, you spin up your entire green deployment, then when you are ready
you cut over from blue to your green deployment. In A/B, the A stands for your
production code and B stands for some code you want to test with live production
 users. So while A is running you start sending some of your traffic to B,
 monitor, and then turn off the traffic to B.

=== Changing our original code

So while "hello OpenShift Ninja Without DB" is awesome, let's make it more
awesome. Let's test how people like to be referred to when starting an
application.

Using your fork of the repository, either edit the code on your local machine
or again, use the GitHub web interface. In _app.py_ change line 12 to

[source]
----
"Hello proper Person"
----

If you are working on your own machine commit and push the changes, if you are
on Github you just need to save the changes.

=== Making the B/Green service

This part is easy, you've already done this once before - let's do it again
but just give it a different name than before:

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-app python:3.5~https://github.com/<your repo>/v3simple-spatial.git -e PG_DATABASE=userdb -e PG_USER=postgres -e PG_PASSWORD=password --name=green
----

The --name is the flag that creates a new deployment and service with the
assigned name.

In your web interface you will see the new deployment and service. Please expose
 the _green_ service as another route and see your wonderful changes.

=== Directing Traffic

Now it's time to get traffic going to both our services at once. We are going
to assume the URL for the spatial-service, that we created in the previous
exercise, is the production URL. Go to the left navigation bar,
choose Applications, and then Routes. In the list of routes, pick the
`v3simple-spatial route.

On the page for the route, click on the button on the top right and chose edit.

Your screen should now look like this:

image::common/blue_green_2.png[]

If you look down the screen a bit you will see a check box that says _add
another service_, go ahead and select it, and then from the dropdown pick
the green service (should be picked automatically). 

Now click the _save_ button on the bottom of the page.

You have just told the _V3simple_spatial_ route to load balance traffic 50/50
between the two different services.

=== Testing Our Services

Now you can open an incognito or private browsing session and go to the URL
for the v3simple-spatial ( it may take one or two different private browsers)
and you should see your new web page.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl "http://v3simple-spatial-<project name>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}"
----

In class we can talk about how this would be A/B versus Blue/Green.

If you want to remove the last service you can just go back to the route, click
on edit again, and then click on the link that says remove the service.
