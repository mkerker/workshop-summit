== Beginning Your Application

Let's go ahead and start our own project using Python. We chose Python for this workshop because we thought it would be easiest for you folks to understand regardless of your coding background. The development pattern you are going to use today will apply to any language you use for development in OpenShift.

WARNING: This code is in NO WAY production type code. This code is trying to be as simple as possible so you learn the basic patterns. In a real app you would not load a DB connection on every request, you would check for exceptions, and you would have more optimized queries.

=== Preparing your GitHub repository

The source code for this project can be found here:

https://github.com/thesteve0/v3simple-spatial

NOTE: See that button up towards the top right that says fork on it - #click it# (you did login with your github account right?)

image::common/2_fork.png[]

Now you should be looking at URL that replaces _thesteve0_ with your github
userid:

https://github.com/<your_userid>/v3simple-spatial



If your repository *doesn't* look this:

image::common/github_repo.png[]

OPTIONAL

This repository is set up for several different learning paths and so it has
several different versions of app.py (the file that runs in a web app for
Python). **If there is already a 1_app.py in the repo, you can skip to the "Adding Code and Doing a Build".**
If not then we need to rename the current app.py to 1_app.py. It's very easy to
do from the web interface:

1. click on the app.py file
2. click on the pencil icon on the far right of the page
3. change the name of the file to 1_app.py (a box right above the edit file box)
4. Scroll down to the *Commit changes* area on the bottom of the page and enter
a message
5. Hit the Commit Changes button

There, you just changed the name of the file in your repository.

Now go back to the top level of your repository and follow the same process to
rename _3_app.py_ to _app.py_.

=== Adding Code and Doing a Build

Go back to **your** fork of _v3simple-spatial_ repository on GitHub. In the middle of the page you will see a button that may say *SSH* on it. If it does, please change that to HTTPS and then click the clipboard to copy the URL in the box.

Our code is ready to use in a build on OpenShift. Let's fire off the build and
deploy. In your terminal enter the following command:

WARNING: Remember to change the GitHub URL below to point to your fork of the
repository

[source, bash]

What we just told OpenShift - take this
https://github.com/openshift/s2i-python[Docker Image] that knows how to build a
standard Python application layout and combine it with this source code and
produce a new Docker Image. As part of this process the _new-app_ command knows
we will need some other OpenShift objects to actually run that resulting image.
The command goes ahead and makes those objects as well.

=== Looking at what we built.

At this point we are going to switch back to the web terminal since it is
easier to look at web sites in a browser. Go ahead and go into your browser and
go to the overview page.

Your screen should contain a piece that looks something like this:

image::common/2_create_route.png[]

You can see that we have the 1 pod running our image that was derived from our
source code and our builder image. There is also other metadata in the box for
the pod that we can return to later. For now I want you to click on the
_Create Route_ button that is highlighted in red. This will create a URL where
we can see the web page for our pod. By default, nothing is exposed to the
outside world and you have to choose to expose it.

Just click _Create_ on the next page that comes up - all the defaults are fine
for our us. You could have also done this at the command line with

[source, bash]
----
$ oc expose service v3simple-spatial
----

Now when you come back to the Overview page there is a URL for the service, go ahead and click it! You will be greeted by the following amazing web content:

*hello OpenShift Ninja without DB*

You have now all built and deployed containers with a working URL - give
yourselves a pat on the back.

== Looking at the Database Parts

=== Reading From the Database

Our python web application to read and write from the PostGIS master and slave services.

When using OpenShift, the way to handle the connection parameters to the DB are handled through environment variables. Rather than hard coding in IP addresses or username/passwords we set environment variables that actually point to those values.

Some of these are set by the platform "automagically" - these are usually
network type variables like hosts to IP and port mappings. The others, that we
need to handle manually right now are database name, username, and password. We
did this already when we did the new app command and added
_--env PG_DATABASE=userdb,PG_USER=postgres,PG_PASSWORD=password_.
This added env variables to the deployment configuration (dc) for our built python Docker image. We add it to the _spatial-app_ dc so it becomes available to all pods controlled by the dc.

You might be wondering where we found those environment variables. In your
browser go to the Application -> Deployments

image::common/4_deployments.png[]

From there click on the deployment for the _replica_ then click on the
environment tab. From there you should see all the environment variables
defined on the dc. We are interested in 3 of the variables:
PG_USER, PG_PASSWORD, and PG_DATABASE. This is where we got the information to
put in the _new-app_ command.

image::common/4_dc_env_variables.png[]

To get a listing from the DB click on the route again and then add _db_ to the end so something like:

http://v3simple-spatial-{{PROJECT_NAME}}.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/db

and you should see a listing of 10 parks.


=== Writing to Master

The great part of what we have set up is we can isolate our writes to master
and our reads from the replica - which is why people usually set up replicas
in the first place. We have already set all the environment variables we needed
but in a more production ready app you would probably use two different
Postgresql accounts, one for reading and one for writing, which would require
new environment variables.

We added code to randomly generate a name and the coords. for a new point
whenever you HTTP POST to the /db URL. Again this is really hacky code for a
workshop - not production code. I will talk you through the code in class.

Finally, to hit this URL you can either install a plugin for your browser or
you can use cURL. By default browsers do an HTTP GET but we need a POST.
There are plenty of plugins for Chrome and Firefox to help you do a HTTP Post -
most of them have the word REST in them. Here is cURL syntax that will exercise
the end point:

Go back to the terminal for your _replica_ pod and do these commands:

[source, bash]
----
# -d says to do a POST and we leave the payload blank
$ curl -X POST "http://v3simple-spatial-<project name>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/db"

# if you want to look at the output in a nicer format you can save it to HTML
$ curl -X POST "http://v3simple-spatial-<project name>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}/db" > /tmp/index.html
----

If you use a browser plugin the URL stays the same and you just tell the plugin
to use a POST.

The response will be the last 10 entries in the DB - which will include your
latest entry. You can go ahead and POST several items and watch the new entries
show up.

That's all we are going to do with the code for now. The rest of the workshop
will be focusing on the advanced features you can get when you combine
container, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and smart engineering.
